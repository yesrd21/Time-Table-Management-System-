Relationships Summary:
- One Class has many Students (1:N)
- One Teacher can teach multiple Subjects (M:N)
- One Subject can be taught to multiple Classes (M:N)
- One Room can host many Timetable entries (1:N)
- One Time Slot can be assigned to multiple classes (1:N)
- Timetable resolves all many-to-many relationships


Constraints & DBMS Logic:
- Unique constraint on (room_id, slot_id) to avoid room clashes
- Unique constraint on (teacher_id, slot_id) to avoid teacher clashes
- Trigger to prevent overlapping schedules
- Stored procedure to auto-generate timetable
- Views for:
   Student Timetable View
   Teacher Timetable View
   Admin Master Timetable View
